  # 'base' specifies the directory where your build command should be run from.
  # If your 'package.json' and source code for the actual site are inside a
  # subdirectory called 'Portofolio_V5' within your repository, then keep this.
  # Otherwise, if 'Portofolio_V5' is your repository root, remove this line.

  # and that it successfully generates your production-ready files.

  # CHANGE 'build' to 'dist' if your build process outputs to a 'dist' folder.
