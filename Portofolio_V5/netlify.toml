  # 'base' specifies the directory where your build command should be run from.
  # If your 'package.json' and source code for the actual site are inside a
  # subdirectory called 'Portofolio_V5' within your repository, then keep this.
  # Otherwise, if 'Portofolio_V5' is your repository root, remove this line.

  # This is the command Netlify will run to build your site.
  # Ensure that 'npm run build' is defined in your package.json scripts
  # and that it successfully generates your production-ready files.

  # This is the directory that Netlify will deploy.
  # CHANGE 'build' to 'dist' if your build process outputs to a 'dist' folder.

# Optional: Set Node.js and NPM flags for consistency
